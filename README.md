My collection of dotfiles and other useful system scripts.

This repository should be cloned into ~/zeus.


Things to be added into these scripts at some point:

- Disable password prompt when running commands requiring `sudo`:
    - Type `sudo visudo`, then add this line at the end of the file: `zplizzi ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL`
